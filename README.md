## Configuration

### Enable the plugin

The plugin configuration is stored in a config file located at ./config/plugins.js. If this file doesn't exists, you will need to create it.


A sample configuration

```javascript
module.exports = ({ env }) => ({
  // ..
	'publisher': {
		enabled: true,
		config: {
			hooks: {
				beforePublish: async ({ strapi, uid, entity }) => {
					console.log('beforePublish');
				},
				afterPublish: async ({ strapi, uid, entity }) => {
					console.log('afterPublish');
				},
				beforeUnpublish: async ({ strapi, uid, entity }) => {
					console.log('beforeUnpublish');
				},
				afterUnpublish: async ({ strapi, uid, entity }) => {
					console.log('afterUnpublish');
				},
			},
		},
	},
	// ..
});
```

### Enable server cron

The `cron.enabled` configuration option needs to be set to true in [Server Configuration](https://docs.strapi.io/developer-docs/latest/setup-deployment-guides/configurations/required/server.html#server-configuration) for the plugin to work.

## Usage

Once the plugin has been installed, configured and enabled a `Publisher` section will be added to the `informations` section of the edit view for all content types (single + collection) that have `draftAndPublish` enabled. The `Publisher` section will provide the ability to schedule publishing and unpublishing of the content type. The content type publication status is checked every minute.

> If the Publisher section does not appear in the admin after the plugin is enabled then a clean rebuild of the admin is required. This can be done by deleting the generated `.cache` and `build` folders and then re-running the `develop` command.
